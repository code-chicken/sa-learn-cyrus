Changelog -- sa-learn-cyrus

    Version 0.4.0 (2020-04-04)

      o NOTE: Some default behavior has changed.
        
      o Use Cyrus mbpath utility to discover mailbox paths.
        
      o Added integration with Kolab for automatic mailbox discovery.
        
      o Eliminate use of temp files and process intermediate results
        in-memory instead.
        
      o Remove obsolete configuration options.
        
      o Default configuration file updated.
        
      o POD / man page updated.

    Version 0.3.5 (2011-11-02)

      o Applied a patch from David Caldwell to use the --virtual-config-dir 
        option of spamd. New parameter sa:virtual_config_dir
        
      o POD / man page updated.

    Version 0.3.4 (2011-10-03)
    
      o To avoid learning from spam/ham directories containing no mails
        every directory is checkd before handed over to sa-learn.
        Learning on larger mail systems is now a lot faster.
        Thanks to Timo Veith for this suggestion.

      o Added support for Bayes storage in SQL database.
        See config parameter sa:bayes_storage = berkely|sql

      o sa:prefs_file is used to get the Berkely DB path in case of 
        sa:bayes_storage = berkely. A missing entry there will no longer
        cause an error. The default DB path is now '~/.spamassassin/bayes'.

      o New config paramter sa:fix_db_permissions to enable/disable
        file permissions in case of sa:bayes_storage = berkely.

      o Added option '-s /bin/sh' to ipurge in order to work even if 
        imap:user has no valid shell. Thanks to Albert Siersema

      o Synchronization of the database may be performed only once after
        all mails have been treated by sa-learn.
        See new parameter sa:sync_once = yes|no
        Thanks to Timo Veith for this suggestion.
        
      o Bugfix: Spam/Ham folders more than two level deep are now supported.
        Thanks to David Caldwell.

      o Prependig the ouput (log) with a tag (date, time, pid) can now
        switched off to avoid additional tagging when piped to syslog.
        See parameter global:log_with_tag. 

      o Some minor bug fixes.  

    Version 0.3.3 (2008-06-18)

      o Bugfix: Base directory of imap spool corrected for the case where
        "domain support" is used without "initial letters".
        Thanks to Andreas Czerniak

    Version 0.3.2 (2008-04-26)

        o Bugfix: With imap:domains not empty (domain support activated)
          the parser didn't find all mailboxes having the same local part.

        o Log output now includes the domain names along with mailboxes.

    Version 0.3.1 (2008-03-22)

        o Changed the routines to make documentation files, to make them 
          usable on Debian/etch, which uses an ancient Pod::Text module

    Version 0.3.0 (2008-03-21)

        o Getopt::Long: added --long --options support
        
        o use Pod::Usage: to use man page and --help with one single 
          documentation
        
        o added option --man to print man page
        
        o added documention (POD) in the code

        o added options --man-text, -man-html, man-mapage=section to create
          man page documentation files
        

    Version 0.3.0rc1 (2008-02-12)
    
        o temp files are now managed by File::Temp

    Version 0.2.6 (2008-02-06)

        o Bugfixes in evaluation of parameters include_list,
          include_regexp, exclude_list, exclude_regexp

    
    Version 0.2.5 (2008-02-04)

        o Cyrus's domain support is now honored.
          To use this option, choose
            [imap]
            domains = one.domain.tld another.domain.tld
          Thanks to Robert Carnecky for suggestions and testing.
        
        o New option to simulate learning and purging of mails.
          This may be handy for testing the setup. This can be activated in
          the configuration file
            [global]
            simulate = no|yes
          or with the command option -s.

          
    Version 0.2.4 (2007-07-29)

        o Cyrus's 'unixhierarchysep' feature is now supported.
          To activate this option, choose
            [imap]
            unixhierarchysep = yes
          in the configuration file.
          Thanks to Franz Mueller <franz@kite2fly.com> for this contribution.
        
        o Copyright statement added

    Version 0.2.3 (2005-05-22)
    
        o Added a new option -d to run sa-learn in debug mode.
          There's also an configuration parameter for this purpose
          in section [sa] of the configuration file:

          debug = no|yes


    Version 0.2.2 (2004-12-15)

        o The function parse_dir (from module File::Listing) has to 
          evaluate the output of the `ls -l` command, which in turn 
          may depend on the system configuration. To avoid these 
          problems, the parse_dir funktion has been replaced with 
          classical opendir/closedir to search for mailbox files.

        o There's a new configuration parameter initial_letter in the 
          section [imap] of the configuration file. If the imap spool 
          has subdivisions with the initial letters of the mailbox 
          names (default) this should be set to
            initial_letter = yes 
          Otherwise set 
            initial_letter = no

        o syslog stuff (which never had worked) has been removed.
